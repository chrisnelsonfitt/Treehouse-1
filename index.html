        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        I am a student that has been studying front end web development for a little over a year now. During collage I took a few programming classes through my university and found that I really enjoyed them. The more I learned the more I started to enjoy it. Since then I have decided to focus a lot more on learning all I can with the goal of eventually making it my career.

        <h2>Goals</h2>

   <p>
I have worked many jobs and have found that front end web development is by far my favorite job I have worked. I really enjoy the fact that there is no end to the learning process and that the field is always challenging me to improve my practical knowledge of the field.
       Some areas I would like to continue to learn are:

          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Currently I am freelance on the side. one of my goals is to eventually get a job with a firm and be able to work full time in the field.</p>
